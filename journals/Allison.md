I opened a new project to try using mongodb instead of postgresql. Everything is working so far. I rewatched the video on jwtdown and
coded along with Curtis.

As a group, we decided to scrap the IMDmeU project and start from scratch. We originally were going with postgresql but changed it to
mongodb. We were having issues on the backend and were struggling to fix the issue with authentication.
Today we created a new project called movie-zone and were able to get docker running for all four of us.
I created accounts/queries, accounts/routers, and the ghi login.js and login.css.
Evan was able to alter some of the accounts content and added .env for the local keys.
So far, the application is looking successful. We can see and try out everything on Swagger UI and on docker.
