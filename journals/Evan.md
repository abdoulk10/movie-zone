Me and allison created the movies api file with queries, routers, tests. I began to fill out some of the routes I knew would be needed.

Front end that allison and abdoul had been working on was functioning however sign in and auth was still not working properly.

The group decided to start fresh and recreate the project using a Mongo DB instead of PostgreSQl DB because of the unfamiliarity I had with it.

As a group, we decided to scrap the IMDmeU project and start from scratch. We originally were going with postgresql but changed it to
mongodb. We then switched the home project base to allisons gitlab repo.
We created a new project called movie-zone and were able to get docker running for all four of us.
I created accounts/queries, accounts/routers, and the ghi login.js and login.css.
I was able to alter some of the accounts content and added .env for the local keys.
So far, the application is looking successful. We can see and try out everything on Swagger UI and on docker.
